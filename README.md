# NGPDS V0.5.7

<img align="right" width="220" src="./logo.png" />

This is a SNK Neogeo Pocket (Color) emulator for the Nintendo DS(i)/3DS.

## How to use

1. Create a folder named "ngpds" in either the root of your flash card or in
 the data folder. This is where settings and save files end up.
2. Now put game/bios files into a folder where you have (NGP) roms, max
 768 games per folder, filenames must not be longer than 127 chars. You can use
 zip-files (as long as they use the deflate compression). CAUTION! Games that
 require SLOT-2 RAM can not be used with zip-files!
3. Depending on your flashcart you might have to DLDI patch the emulator.

Note! You need a bios to be able to save in game.
The save file should be compatible with most other NeoGeo Pocket emulators.

When the emulator starts, you can either press L+R or tap on the screen to open
up the menu.
Now you can use the cross or touchscreen to navigate the menus, A or double tap
to select an option, B or the top of the screen to go back a step.

To select between the tabs use R & L or the touchscreen.

Since the DS/DS Lite only has 4MB of RAM you will need a SLOT-2/GBA cart with
 RAM on these devices to play games larger than 2MB.
